# AI Household
This repo documents my journey to an AI-driven household,<br> 
compounding small data-driven automations into day-to-day amusements.

Imagine, having self-hosted agents that know everything about you<br> 
providing you everyday help without exposing your data to third parties.

This requires models hosting, a webchat interface, data management, and specialized agents.<br> 
Our strategy is to adopt open-source solutions where suitable options exists, <br> 
while focusing our efforts on overall orchestration and agents<br> 
adding long-term value to our daily lifes.

## Note: Self-hosting requires significant resources

While our setup could in theory run on any hardware,<br>
the models self-hosting part requires significant resources.

GPU VRAM (or Unified Memory) is the king determining how large a model you can host<br>
and the memory speed affects how fast it will handle inference.

Unless you have a deep personal interest in self-hosting,<br>
my recommendation is to simply adopt one of the commercial solutions instead.<br>
Personally, I'm still using for my family Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude for a few CHF.  

For me and my wife, the main benefit of self-hosting are data privacy and the entertainment<br> 
of having our own R&D to run AI/ML workloads while still leveraging major cloud providers where beneficial.
